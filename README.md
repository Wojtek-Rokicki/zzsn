# Neural Nets Project - Graphs reconstruction with Top-N generator

# TODO's:
- [x] Code to our problem adjustment
- [x] Create adjacency matrices from datasets
- [x] Batch data
- [x] Create pytorch objects i.e. dataloader etc.
- [x] Resolve conflicts by running on new dataset
- [x] Code refactorization
- [x] Measurements
