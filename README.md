# Neural Nets Project - Graphs reconstruction with Top-N generator

# TODO's:
- [ ] Code to our problem adjustment
- [ ] Create adjacency matrices from datasets
- [ ] Batch data
- [ ] Create pytorch objects i.e. dataloader etc.
- [ ] Resolve conflicts by running on new dataset (25, 26 may)
- [ ] Code refactorization
- [ ] Measurements
